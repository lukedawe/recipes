Serves: 4 (probably 5 or 6; this is powerful stuff)

- 1tbsp golden syrup
- 210ml hot water
- 75ml lemon juice (if fresh then make sure to add an extra 25g of sugar)

## Method

1. If using fresh juice, juice the lemons.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, golden syrup and warm water until the sugar is dissolved then add the lemon juice and stir until fully combined.
3. Let the mixture cool by putting the bowl in an ice bath (sink or something).
4. Put the mixture in the Ninja tub and freeze for 24 hours before putting it in the Creami set to sorbet.
