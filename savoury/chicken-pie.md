# Chicken Pie

## Ingredients

### Pastry
You can alternately use a 320g ready-rolled sheet of shortcrust pastry instead of below.

- 100g very cold butter, cut into small cubes
- 200g plain flour, plus more to dust surface
- 1/2 tbsp salt
- 1 small egg, beaten

### Filling

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 600g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, diced
- 30g butter
- 300g leeks, trimmed and cut into 5mm slices
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- 300ml chicken stock, or dry white wine
- 150ml double cream
- 2 tsp thyme leaves
- 1/2 small buunch of flat-leaf parsley or tarragon, leaves finely chopped
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Make the pastry, if needed. Using your fingertips or a food processor, rub the butter into the flour and salt until it resembles breadcrumbs, then add 2 tablespoons of very cold water until the dough comes together. Remove it from the food processor if using, and then knead gently on your work surface until just smooth, taking care to not overwork it. Shape the dough into a disc, wrap it in cling film and chill while you make the filling.
2. Heat the olive oil in a casserole pan over a moderate heat. Add the chicken and a big pinch of salt and brown the meat, stirring often, for about 5 minutes, until nicely bronzed in parts. Put the part-cooked chicken on a plate and wipe out the casserole pan.
3. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6.
4. Melt the butter in the pan over a moderate-low heat. Add the leeks and cook for around 10 minutes, until very, very soft. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more, until fragrant. Add the 2 tablespoons of flour and cook for 1 minute more.
5. Add the chicken back to the pan, then add the chicken stock and cream, turn up the heat to high and bring to a simmer stirring all the time. Reduce the heat to moderate and cook the pie filling for around 10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Keep an eye on the pan, stirring occasionally to ensure the sauce doesn't catch. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the herbs, mustard and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
6. Roll out the pastry to 1cm thick (unless using ready-rolled). Then, cut the pastry to size, so that the pastry lid covers the pie filling in the pan. Lay the pastry on top of the filling and cut a small air vent. Brush the top with beaten egg.
7. Bake the pie in the oven for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and crisp, and the pie filling is bubbling hot. Allow the pie to rest for around 5 minutes before serving
