# Salmon Rice Bowl

## Ingredients

### Salmon

- 2 x 4 oz Salmon Filet, cut into 1-inch cubes
	- Alternatively, you can just use precooked salmon and skip the cooking salmon stage of the recipe.
- 1 tsp Kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 1/2 tsp Onion Powder

### Rice Bowl

- 2 cup Cooked Rice, any kind works
- 1 Avocado diced or sliced
- 1/2 cup Carrots, shredded
- 1/2 cup Mini Cucumbers
- 1/2 cup Edamame cooked
- 2 tbsp Soy Sauce, or Tamari or Coconut Aminos
- 4 tbsp Mayonnaise
- 4 tsp Sriracha
- Sesame Seeds, optional for garnish

## Method
### Salmon (Uncooked)

1. Preheat the air fryer to 200°C. Remove the skin from the salmon filets and cut the salmon into 1 inch cubes.
2. Place the cubed salmon in a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and onion powder.
3. Place the salmon in the air fryer basket in a single layer and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until the internal temperature has reached 50° C. Feel free to pan fry over medium-high heat in a skillet for the same amount of time if you prefer.

### Rice Bowl

1. Place the cooked rice in the bowl first. Layer on the cooked salmon, avocado, cucumber, and edamame.
2. Stir together the mayonnaise and sriracha sauce until combined. Drizzle on the soy sauce and garnish with sesame seeds.
