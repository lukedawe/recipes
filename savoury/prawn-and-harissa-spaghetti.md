# Prawn and Harissa Spaghetti

## Ingredients

- 100g long-stem broccoli, cut into thirds
- 180g dried spaghetti, regular or wholemeal
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large garlic clove, crushed
- 150g cherry tomatoes, halved
- 150g raw king prawns (or pre-cooked prawns and add them with the pasta at the end to warm up)
- 2 tbsp rose harissa paste
- 1 lemon, finely zested

# Method

1. Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 5 mins, or until tender (or until the water has just started to turn a slight green colour). Drain and set aside. Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a ladleful of cooking water.
2. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic clove and fry over a low heat for 2 mins. 
3. Add the tomatoes to the pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 mins, or until beginning to soften and turn juicy. Stir through the prawns and cook for 2 mins, or until turning pink. Add the harissa and lemon zest, stirring to coat.
4. Toss the cooked spaghetti (and pre-cooked prawns) and pasta water through the prawns and harissa. Stir through the broccoli, season to taste and serve.
